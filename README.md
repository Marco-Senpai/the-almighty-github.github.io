## Topics Learned ##

The topics covered in the reading can be very daunting if you don't use a growth mindset. But the value that they bring to your life once you understand them can be immense. The topics include Github, Markdown, and repositories.

### _The Almighty Github_ ###

Github is basically a lovely tool that allows you to collaborate with others and handle version control very easily. It does this through several methods that include repos or repositories, branches, and commits. Repos are at their root folders that can store code, text, and images. Branches are the different versions of projects you've created. And commits are your saves that include a message that explains the alternate changes that have been made.

### _Markdown_ ###

Markdown in the simpliest way I can put it is a straightforawrd language that is very similar to HTML that is often used for text on a document. It uses syntax that is also very similar to HTML as well. For instance if you want the header to have a larger font than other characters you use one hashtag whereas if you want smaller fonts you would use multiple hashtags in the same way you would use "h1" or "h4" with HTML.

### _The Repo Man_ ###

As I stated before repos are basically folders for what you need to store, specifically being the the projects you are working on. This can inlcude precious tedious code that you have been laboring away on or simply some text that you plan to use for something else. Please take care in controlling these repos appropriately as not to lose important progress made.
